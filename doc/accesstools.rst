In order to foster community development, we are using Git for our version
control system. Specifically, at this time, we are using github as the main
repository for OpenAerialMap.

The Git repository is currently available from:

  http://github.com/crschmidt/oam/

Anyone who is interested can issue a pull request through Github.
